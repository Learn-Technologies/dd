Computerization has become a common phenomenon for any organization either public or private. Installations of latest technology, software require high end Hardware configurations and constant upgradation ofSystems. Over a period of time Systems, Hardware, Software and Technology becomes obsolete and / or gets worn out, which accumulates e-Waste in the organization. The important reasons to declare them as e-Waste in the organization may be technology becoming obsolete, items beyond economic repair, non-repairable and physically damaged. An attempt has been made in drafting guidelines for e-Waste Policy and Procedures for the Veer Narmad South Gujarat University, Surat, which would help everyuser in deciding and declaring an item as e-Waste for disposal. Background of the e-Waste Policy and Procedures The usage of Information Technology at VNSGU was created with various reasons such as education, research, help in promoting and developing the Information Technology (IT) industry in planned manner and in order to keep pace with rapidly growing IT industry.

      "Preface of the e-Waste Policy and Procedures The technical advancements in Computer Hardware, Software, and Communication (aka Information Technology) are very rapidly growing. Computerization has become a common phenomenon for any organization either public or private. Installations of latest technology, software require high end Hardware configurations and constant upgradation ofSystems. Over a period of time Systems, Hardware, Software and Technology becomes obsolete and / or gets worn out, which accumulates e-Waste in the organization. The important reasons to declare them as e-Waste in the organization may be technology becoming obsolete, items beyond economic repair, non-repairable and physically damaged. An attempt has been made in drafting guidelines for e-Waste Policy and Procedures for the Veer Narmad South Gujarat University, Surat, which would help everyuser in deciding and declaring an item as e-Waste for disposal.",
      "Background of the e-Waste Policy and Procedures The usage of Information Technology at VNSGU was created with various reasons such as education, research, help in promoting and developing the Information Technology (IT) industry in planned manner and in order to keep pace with rapidly growing IT industry. The Department of Computer Science, Department of M.Sc. (I.T.) and Computer Centre has been created at VNSGU for evolving suitable IT related education in the society and usage in the organization with the basic philosophy to realize the dream of taking benefits of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Objectives of the e-Waste Policy and Procedures The objective of this policy is to design economic, efficient, and fast process for the disposal of obsolete, unused and dead IT Products / Equipment in various Departments and administrative sections of VNSGU, Surat. In backdrop of resurgent growth of the IT infrastructure at VNSGU, each departments and offices lay a greater dependency on IT for Office Automation, Education and Research, which calls for commitment to eco-responsibility need to be envisaged for the economy, society, and the environment. Considering the average life period of IT products to be of 5 years depending upon its intensity of its use, serviceability, technology and other related factors, many IT Products / Equipment become unusable. In a similar manner, IT Products / Equipment across the universityhave become either non-repairable or beyond economical repairs or technologically obsolete. It is therefore highly essential that Policy and Procedures must be in place to address the concerns for disposal of condemned IT Products / Equipment at VNSGU.",
      "Definitions and Example of the e-Waste Policy and Procedures e-Waste Electrical and electronic equipment, whole or in part, which are technically obsolete, beyond economical repairs, non-repairable or physically damaged which are intended to be discarded as waste. Calculate base value using straight line depreciation method with current rate of depreciation say 40%.Consider the following example: Purchase value (in Rs.) : 70,000/- Depreciation Rate (in %) : 40% Total year of purchase : 5 years (From Actual Date of Purchase)",
      "Depreciation 40% (3) = (2) x 0.40",
      "Salvage Value After Depreciation (4) = (2) – (3)",
      "Law of the e-Waste Policy and Procedures The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF & CC) notified e-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011, which came into force w.e.f. 01.05.2012. The major objective is to ensure environmentally sound management of E-waste, due its exponential growth. The following list of Items / Equipment covered in Schedule – I of e-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011",
      "Category of electrical and electronic equipment",
      "i. Information technology and telecommunication equipment",
      "ii. Consumer electrical and electronics",
      "The IT Products / Equipment can be disposed on following grounds: • Technically Obsolete IT Products / Equipment: o Completed 5 years lifespan and not in working condition o Completed 5 years lifespan and technology outdated affecting performance and outputthat is expected out of it. o Package Software can only be disposed by declaring it as technically obsolete when no more updates or support available from OEM.",
      "The salient features of the e-waste policy and procedures are as follows: 1. These guidelines are mainly for safe disposal of e-waste at the VNSGU. 2. These guidelines should be read in connection with the current e-Waste policy of state and central government. In case of any contradiction, the GujaratGovernment’s e-Waste policy will supersede these guidelines. 3. The VNSGU shall follow these guidelines in disposing of e-waste. Each office of the Departments / Centres / Cells / Offices at VNSGU shall be first required to prepare a Report – I (As Per Annexure – III) to be submitted to University e-waste Disposal Committee (UDC).",
      "o The ULDC Committee shall comprise of following: 1. The Hon’ble Vice Chancellor (Chairman). 2. Dean of the Computer Science and Information Technology Faculty. 3. One Representative of Finance Committee. 4. Two IT Experts to be nominated by the Hon’ble Vice Chancellor. 5. Registrar [Ex-Officio]"

Remember Me Login Cancel Institutional Distinctiveness Home - Institutional Distinctiveness Institutional Distinctiveness Home Institutional Distinctiveness > Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Keeping in pace with the development of information technology and the need of the University, a well designed ERP system has been implemented for University business processes. It includes: University Management System (UMS) – student life cycle management, Human Resource Management System (HRMS) - leave management, activity management, salary and tax, Admission System – Processing all the admission to the University and its affiliated colleges, Department Management System – For maintaining internal marks and attendance of the students, departmental activities, Students fees management, Hostel Management System – for hostel admission, room allocation, hostel fees record keeping etc. Alumni System – for alumni registration and activity management, Dead Stock Register System – for record-keeping of dead stock in various departments, Recruitment System – for managing various types of recruitment processing on the campus, Placement Management – for managing project and placement related activities etc. Some of the modules like meeting management, e-filing, Grievance management etc., are ready for implementation. > Pandemic Preparedness and Response During the critical phase of the Covid-19 Pandemic, the RT-PCR service augmented the testing facilities in view of the population affected. The state government instructed the state universities to set up the RTPCR Service facilities on the campus. The University quickly responded to the instructions by the government and the Department of Bio-sciences took a concrete initiative to establish a self-sustained RT-PCR Laboratory, which became functional and began giving the facility of testing at affordable rates to the general public. In addition, the University's health centre also organized COVID-19 awareness and vaccination camps to address the gravity of the COVID-19 pandemic. • Question Papers Distribution System The University has also implemented the new practice of sending question papers online to the examination centres by the Question Papers Distribution System. (QPDS), ensuring more efficiency and secrecy regarding the procedure. Examinations have also been conducted through online mode, with online proctoring through a centralized monitoring system during the pandemic. A well-equipped centralized assessment facility has been created for the quicker declaration of results. • Online Teaching-Learning COVID-19 pandemic struck the whole world, adversely influencing the dynamics of academic worlds, including universities and colleges. As a byproduct of collective efforts to face and address the global emergency, educational agencies attempted to utilize digital resources to conduct online teaching, learning and evaluation, overcoming physical access and space constraints. In a way, this also led to an accidental and fortunate discovery of online resources and their utilization under urgent pressure for a developing country like India, which proved a blessing ultimately in disguise. The faculties of all the departments, including a few faculties with less computer literacy, conducted online classes at a time convenient to the students, using digital platforms like Google Meet and Zoom. Online sources have become almost a permanent feature of teaching and learning activities. Accordingly, the internal assessment connected with the students' presentation of papers and evaluation through viva voce has also been regularly conducted on digital platforms. > NEP( New Education Policy) 2020 The University has started preparing itself to implement the provisions envisaged in the National Education Policy 2020 in its letter and spirit.

The University is highly concerned about raising the standards of indoor air and water quality. The University has also banned the selling of all tobacco products on campus. Energy Audit & Conservation: 1. Most new buildings constructed have a North-South orientation to maximize gains for natural light into habitable spaces. Most habitable spaces have cross-ventilation through properly sized windows to open them during fair weather and reduce air conditioning needs. 2. University has initiated a sticker campaign in various departments to switch off all the electronic gadgets after its use. All the rooms have a tag titled \"Please Switch off the Lights After its Use\". Stickers requesting the students and staff to switch off the lights when the rooms or facilities are not in use have been pasted on all switchboards. The use of transparent glass windows provides natural light in all classrooms, cabins and offices. 3. The University has progressively replaced all the incandescent bulbs and gradually increased the use of CFLs and T5 tube lights. 4. The old fans which were 40-50 years old have been replaced by energy-efficient fans which consume less than half the power. 5. The existing ACs are turned off when not required. Window Air Conditioners are replaced with more efficient split ACs and the temperature is set at 25 Degree Celsius. 6. Tanks are filled with water by water pumps. Initiatives are taken to turn-off the motors when the tank is filled. Leaking taps are attended to immediately 7. The water heaters in the girl's hostel are also operated with solar power. 8. Low energy embodied materials are used for construction of buildings. In climates with extreme day–night temperature variations, embodied energy material can significantly offset the energy used for heating and cooling the room. 9. Plantation of trees has increased absorption of carbon di-oxide emitted in the atmosphere.It has provided an effective screen in covering carbon inflow. Solid Waste Management: University has made the arrangements for every day collections of solid and liquid waste from various departments and sections. Surat Municipal Corporation collects all these waste through their vehicles every day. Vermicompost disposal tanks are constructed at different location of the university campus. These decomposed fertilizers are used by Rural Studies, Bioscience and Biotechnology departments for recycle purpose. Liquid Waste management: During the chemistry/bioscience/biotechnology experiments, the liquids/solvents generated are being disposed by the means of evaporation or extraction with volatile solvents. In certain cases the reuse of waste liquid becomes mandatory. Some of the hazardous liquids are processed by different methods such as double distillations, mixed with a non-toxic chemicals like natural products extracts or some of the bio active materials etc. Hazardous liquid are also converted as catalyst by means of ionic liquids which can be utilized as catalyst for getting certain type of bio chemical entities. Bio/chemical/medical waste is collected by a professional agency and disposed of in a scientific manner as per GPECB and SMC norms. E-Waste Management: The E-Waste management policy of the University is under preparation. University minimizes creation of e-waste. For this, University has practices for almost all the electronic equipment to be purchased under buy back scheme. University always tries to minimize e-waste by distributing old desktop computers to various teaching departments and administrative offices where very smaller amount of working out is required. Water harvesting: University has three large water reservoirs to cater the needs of various hostels. University has initiated efforts to harvest rainwater and utilize it after rainy season. The capacities of these ponds are (a) 774 lacs liters (behind Computer Science Department) (b) 164 lacs liters (Pond near administration building) (c) ~40 lacs liters (Near Bioscience Department) (d) ~40 lacs liters (Bapalal Vaidya building) (e) A Big rainwater harvesting tank (Behind Chemistry building) is constructed to store the rain water. Using these ponds, we can store/save 12 crore liters of water. To use the non-conventional energy, University are using solar panels plus nearly 51 solar street lighting panels in the campus. These has capacity to generate nearly 358 kW electricity. One solar heaters with capacity of 1000 liters is installed in international boys' and other 8 boys' (8000 liters capacity) and 6 girls' (6000 liters) hostels. Efforts for Carbon neutrality: University has taken some initiatives for carbon neutrality like – printing is done on both sides of the paper, old print-outs are used as note paper and all documents are edited thoroughly before printing. Some department notices and information are sent via email/SMS. Use of plastic cups is discouraged. University celebrates environment day on 5th June and plantation day on 7th July every year. University has started initiative of giving plant pots as a souvenir and memento for welcoming guest and visitors. The green cover encompasses 30% of the campus land area with various shady trees which is maintained by estate department. Urban Forestry Programme of Nature Club, Surat carries out plantation activities on campus in association with the University. University has also initiated efforts to carry out indexing of the trees on campus. All the trees are labelled with the generic name, traditional name and its medicinal use. Moreover students of various departments plant trees around their department. The University has 'Nakshtravan' garden which consist of wide variety of plant species. Use of renewable energy: University has installed solar roof top in various department buildings like Department of Computer Science, Department of Human Resource and Development, ACDC and others. With the significant capacity to generate and use this nonconventional solar power, adequate funds are spent. The University has also installed solar water heater in various hostels. Green Audit: • The University has given utmost importance to eco-friendly environment in the campus. • An experienced person takes care of developing and maintaining greenery. The green cover encompasses 30% of the campus land area with various shady trees. • The University has taken its share of social responsibility in reducing carbon emission through renewable energy methods like solar generation. Hence, no separate green audit is conducted. • Departments of the University regularly organizes Environment Awareness Campaigns. • The activities of such a campaign are screening movies, guest lecture series, and skits to spread awareness to be eco-friendly. In this campaigns teaching, non-teaching and students actively participate. • The University has done many plantation campaigns. Every year students and teachers of the department are actively involved in the tree plantation activity. The University is planning to conduct Green Audit in the near future. Flora and Fauna: The green campus offers an environment to boost healthy living and creative thinking. The lush green university campus is rich in biodiversity in flora and fauna. The colourful presence of butterflies and peacocks moving around and the rare sight of exotic birds like Kingfisher, Golden Oriole, Indian Paradise Fly Catcher, Plain Prinia, Gray Francolin, etc. add to the beauty of the campus. The sweet bird calls resound over the campus, making it enticing and captivating. The fireflies on the campus illuminate the campus at night. -->",

One of the critical services being provided is the e-mail service to its officers, office bearers, employees, and students. The growth of VNSGU e-mail services is growing fast and the time has come for stream lining of the e-mail services by adopting a single virtual e-mail server for the all stakeholders. VNSGU is in the process of rationalizing the e-mail addresses offered to its users. The present Version 1.0 of the “VNSGU Policy on e-mail address” is a step in that direction. 2. Applicability: This policy is applicable to all the users of the VNSGU e-mail services. 3. e-mail Address Policy: The major problem that is to be resolved in giving the e-mail addresses to the users is to ensure the address resolution when multiple similar names occur, which is a common occurrence. This problem is found to occur in everywhere and therefore there are some proven name resolution methods that have been used by many of the service providers. There are two major naming methods that are used in India. First pattern, the “surname” or the “family name” followed by initials of given name is used to address a person and the second is the “given name” followed by “surname” or “family name” is used for addressing a person. In some cases, one gets to see the usage of a large number of initials attached to a given name. Therefore, we need to take the differences in the naming mechanism to be reflected in the e-mail addresses so that the address resolution problem is properly taken care of. 4. e-mail domain Resolution: The policy refers to both the e-mail domains, which shall be virtual e-mail domains, and the e-mail addresses. 4.1 e-mail addresses: The VNSGU e-mail addresses shall have a single domain by default “vnsgu.ac.in” and no sub names. That is all the e-mail addresses that shall be operative over the VNSGU e-mail service shall have the same unified address part as “@vnsgu.ac.in”. Therefore any e-mail address given to any one in VNSGU shall have the same unified address part “@vnsgu.ac.in” 4.2 e-mail Addresses: The address will have at most two parts. That is the address would look like “aaaa.bbbb@vnsgu.ac.in” or “pqr@vnsgu.ac.in”. For Students : The first part “aaaa” can be either a given name or a family name with initials and the second part “bbbb” will be comprising of combination of college/institute id and student’s information. For official of University: The first part “aaaa” is designation of e-mail holder and the second part “bbbb” will be the section or department. For Teachers of University: The only part “aaaa” is combination of initials followed by “surname” or “family name” of the e-mail id holder. For Teachers of Colleges Affiliated with University : The first part “aaaa” is designation of e-mail holder and the second part “bbbb” will be the college id. Officers of University : The only part “aaaa” is designation of e-mail holder. Below are given a few cases that may cause address resolution problems and the proposed method of allocating e-mail addresses is presented. A few examples are given below to illustrate the procedure that would be adopted in allocating the e-mail addresses: 4.2.1.

      "VEER NARMAD SOUTH GUJARAT UNIVERSITY (VNSGU) has a network providing a host of services over the Internet. One of the critical services being provided is the e-mail service to its officers, office bearers, employees, and students. The growth of VNSGU e-mail services is growing fast and the time has come for stream lining of the e-mail services by adopting a single virtual e-mail server for the all stakeholders. VNSGU is in the process of rationalizing the e-mail addresses offered to its users. The present Version 1.0 of the “VNSGU Policy on e-mail address” is a step in that direction.",
